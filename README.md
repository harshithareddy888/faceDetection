# faceDetection
This project performs real-time **face detection** using your webcam, powered by Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. It draws bounding boxes around detected faces in each frame.

Face detection is the process of identifying human faces in images or video streams. It's a foundational step in many computer vision tasks like:

- Face recognition
- Emotion analysis
- Face tracking
- AR filters and security applications

This project uses **MediaPipe's face detection solution**, which is optimized for real-time performance.

#  How It Works

1. Captures video from your webcam
2. Processes each frame with MediaPipe's face detector
3. Draws a rectangle around each detected face

#  Dependencies
       pip install opencv-python mediapipe
